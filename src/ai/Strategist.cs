    // TODO: First, determine if this is even necessary
    // TODO: And if it is, then it should provide additional weights to Tactician based on overall game state

    // Ex. Healers are worth more if there are fewer of them on the team or if the healer's team is low on health
    // Ex. Prioritize healing if you are the only healer on a team
    // Ex. Mages (or low max health?) targets are higher priority
    // Ex. Near death targets are higher priority


    // Other stuff?
    //  TP remaining (for you or targets)
    //  Deathblow chance
    //  Pro-rate damage value based on remaining HP
    //  Turn order
    //  Speed
    //  Damage dealing capability
    //  Concentration of enemies/allies on the map
    //  Choke points
    //  Height
